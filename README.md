About
GraphQL[1] is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.[2] It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.[1]. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed. This avoids both the problems of over-fetching as well as under-fetching of data. GraphQL has been implemented in multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python[3], Ruby, Java, C#, Scala, Go, Elixir, Erlang, PHP, and Clojure.

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. For example, a GraphQL service that tells us who the logged in user is (me) as well as that user's name might look something like this:
